* [Prezzo](https://www.prezzorestaurants.co.uk/): NOT an independent restaurant, so feel free to remove this, but they do the best **gluten free** delivery Italian in Birmingham (GF pizza, pasta and garlic bread), and cover most areas.

Japanese and Sushi

Chinese
-------
* Dragon City: Rated the cleanest Chinese restaurant in the Hall Green area, also they're a very friendly family business, offer generous portions and do a traditional takeaway menu but cooked fresh to order. Been very quiet in there recently but the food is amazing! Call them on 0121 702 2474.

Indian
-------
* [Alleppey Boat](http://www.alleppeyboat.co.uk/): Probably the best Indian in the Hall Green/Solihull area, especially if you love Keralan food. The lamb pasanda is very nice in particular. Order on [Deliveroo](https://deliveroo.co.uk/).
